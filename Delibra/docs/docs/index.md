# Delibra Documentation

Delibra is a decentralized library and marketplace for books where authors and readers get access to both paid and free books. We also did not limit our DAPP to native book owners; Students in schools can use it to upload past exam questions, chefs can upload book recipes, and anybody can publish articles. We want to immortalize information, and we are using blockchain to do so

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at <http://localhost:3000/>.

Open `docs/index.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

# The First Decentralized Library Built on Polygon Blockchain
---


## Overview

Delibra is a decentralized library and marketplace for books where authors and readers get access to both paid and free books. We also did not limit our DAPP to native book owners; Students in schools can use it to upload past exam questions, chefs can upload book recipes, and anybody can publish articles. We want to immortalize information, and we are using blockchain to do so


### üèö Structure
The directory is made up of two open source smart contracts written in solidity in the [Delibra](https://github.com/Delibra-xyz/Decentralized-Library/tree/staging/Delibra/contracts) folder, 

The Book cover contract and the User authentication smart contracts are  currently deployed on the Polygon zkEVM testnet. 


[Book cover contract address](https://explorer.public.zkevm-test.net/tx/0xb6d352c789bab5ab0bfdc197f0431382f42bf91ce91975217ff641427de98994)


The [Ui-library](https://github.com/Delibra-xyz/Decentralized-Library/tree/staging/library-ui) directory holds the frontend of the dapp built using Nextjs and Chakra Ui.

The Files which are encrypted using lit protocol are store on  are stored on Bundlr  using Arweave [ https://github.com/Delibra-xyz/Decentralized-Library/tree/staging/library-ui/arweave]

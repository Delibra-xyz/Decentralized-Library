# The First Decentralized Library Built on Polygon Blockchain
---


## Overview

Delibra is a decentralized library and marketplace for books where authors and readers get access to both paid and free books. We also did not limit our DAPP to native book owners; Students in schools can use it to upload past exam questions, chefs can upload book recipes, and anybody can publish articles. We want to immortalize information, and we are using blockchain to do so
